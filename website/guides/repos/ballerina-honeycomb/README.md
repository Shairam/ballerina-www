## Integration with Honeycomb

 Honeycomb is a tool used for investigating on how well your system product is working in various conditions (for example - high traffic). Through honeycomb we are able to collect data of your own software which can be broken down into various entities to observe its performance specifically. [Read more about Honeycomb.](#about-honeycomb)
 
 
The following are the sections available in this guide.

- [What you'll build](#what-you’ll-build)
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Implementation](#implementation)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Configuration with Honeycomb](#testing-with-honeycomb)
     - [Traces](#views-of-traces)
     - [Metrics](#metrics)



## What you’ll build 

To perform this integration with Honeycomb,  a real world use case of a very simple student management system is used.

![Honeycomb](images/observe.png "Ballerina-Honeycomb")

- **Make Requests** : To perform actions on student  management service, a console based client program has been written in Ballerina for your ease of making requests.

## Prerequisites
 
- [Ballerina Distribution](https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- [MYSQL](https://github.com/Shairam/Ballerina-Honeycomb/blob/master/resources/testdb.sql)
- A Text Editor or an IDE 

## Implementation

> If you want to skip the basics, you can download the GitHub repo and continue from the "Testing" section.

### Implementing database
 - Start MYSQL server in your local machine.
 - Create a database with name `testdb` in your MYSQL localhost. If you want to skip the database implementation, then directly import the [testdb.sql](https://github.com/Shairam/Ballerina-Honeycomb/blob/master/resources/testdb.sql) file into your localhost. You can find it in the Github repo.
 
 
 

### Create the project structure
        
 For the purpose of this guide, let's use the following package structure.
        
    
    ballerina-honeycomb
           └── guide
                ├── students
                │   ├── student_management_service.bal
                │   ├── student_marks_management_service.bal
                ├── client_service
                |         └── client_main.bal
                └── ballerina.conf
        

- Create the above directories in your local machine, along with the empty `.bal` files.

- You have to add the following lines in your [ballerina.conf](https://github.com/Shairam/Ballerina-Honeycomb/blob/master/ballerina.conf) to send the service traces to Honeycomb in Zipkin format using Opentracing.

```ballerina
[b7a.observability.tracing]
enabled=true
name="zipkin"

[b7a.observability.tracing.zipkin]
reporter.hostname="localhost"
reporter.port=9411

# Send the spans in V1 format as honeycomb-opentracing-proxy supports on V1
reporter.api.context="/api/v1/spans"
reporter.api.version="v1"


reporter.compression.enabled=false
```

- Then open the terminal and navigate to `ballerina-honeycomb/guide` and run Ballerina project initializing toolkit.

``
   $ ballerina init
``
- Also you need to clone and build the ballerina-zipkin-extension in the following repository [https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-observability/tree/master/tracing-extensions/modules.](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-observability/tree/master/tracing-extensions/modules) 

- After building  move to `ballerina-zipkin-extension>/target/distribution/` and copy all the jar files to your `bre/lib` folder in your ballerina distribution.
### Development of student and marks service with Honeycomb

- Now we have completed the implementation of student management service with marks management service.


## Testing 

### Invoking the student management service

You can start both the services by opening a terminal and navigating to `ballerina-honeycomb/guide`, and execute the following command.

```
$ ballerina run --config <path-to-conf>/ballerina.conf students
```

 You need to start the honeycomb-opentracing-proxy. This can be done by using docker. Docker is used to pull the image for honeycomb-opentracing-proxy.
 Run the following command.
 
 ```
 docker run -p 9411:9411 honeycombio/honeycomb-opentracing-proxy -k APIKEY -d traces
```
- -k represent the API KEY you will be getting when you sign in to honeycomb account.

- -d represents the dataset you are going to send your trace data to.

 You can observe the service performance by making some http requests to the above services. This is made easy for you as 
 there is a client program implemented. You can start the client program by opening another terminal and navigating to ballerina-honeycomb/guide
 and run the below command
 
 ```
 $ ballerina run client_service
 ``` 
 
### Testing with Honeycomb
 
#### Views of traces
 After making http request, go to [Honeycomb website](https://honeycomb.io) then move to your dataset.

   When you are in your dataset in Honeycomb UI you get to see a button called `New query`, and when you click on that 
   you can write your own queries on the metrics that you have received.
 - You are expected to see the traces as below when you include traceId in the breakdown category.
 
![Honeycomb](images/traces1.png "Honeycomb")
 
 - To view a particular trace click on the traceId column. And you will see as below
 
![Honeycomb](images/traces2.png "Honeycomb")
    
 - To view span details with metrics click on a particular span and you are expected to see as below
 
![Honeycomb](images/traces3.png "Honeycomb")
     
     
#### Metrics
     
  You can perform some detailed queries in order to look deep in the performance of your services. Here are some examples:-
  
  - [Total requests](#total-requests)
  - [Resources with high response time](#resources-with-high-response-time)
  - [Counts of database manipulations](#counts-of-database-manipulations)
  - [Mostly hit resources](#mostly-hit-resources)
  - [Average response time](#average-response-time)
  - [Error detection](#error-detection)
  - [Percentiles of response duration](#percentiles-of-response-duration)
  - [Last 1 minute summary](#last-1-minute-summary)
  - [Last 5 minutes summary](#last-5-minutes-summary)
  - [Last 1 hour summary](#last-1-hour-summary) 
  
##### Total requests

                         1. BREAK DOWN - name
                         2. CALCULATE PER GROUP - COUNT_DISTINCT(traceId), AVG(durationMs)
                         3. FILTER - name does-not-start-with ballerina/ 
                         4. LIMIT - 100 
                         
                       We filter out the other default ballerina resource using the filter query.

#### Last 1 hour summary
           
###### Per service
          
   To find the total request count per service with average response time for the last 1 hour :-
  > Duration can be set on the top right corner of the query builder. You can customize the 
   time period within which you wanted to get the metrics.

##### Honeycomb UI Boards
   
   These queries can be predefined and added to the board so that the live observability can be achieved without building queries multiple times. 
   
   To add a query to a board : -
      
   - Create a board.  You can create a board when you run a query. You will see an option “Add to Board” above the query builder.
   
![Honeycomb](images/table1.png "Honeycomb") 
   
     
   -  After creating a board select the board. In this guide a board “Requests details” has been already created. Give a name for your query ,add description to be more clear and save the query
    
![Honeycomb](images/table2.png "Honeycomb") 
   
   - You can view your boards by clicking the “My Boards” in the team’s main menu in honeycomb UI.

![Honeycomb](images/table4.png "Honeycomb")

   
   -  You can click on any of the boards and run the query for that particular instant.

## About Honeycomb
The observability is being achieved by sending traces to the honeycomb UI, in which various queries are executed in order to analyse various conditions where the service is being used by the clients. 
 
 Traces refers to the series of the flow of events that occurs when a request is being made and a response is given back. 
 
 
![Honeycomb](images/spans2.png "Honeycomb")



For example a client requesting data from the database as above.
E refers to an event.
A trace is the path from E1 to E4.

Traces are further broken down into spans. 
Spans can be defined as a single operation, i.e server requesting from database to obtain data and receiving it (E2+E3). 
Spans contain data which can be used for interpreting the performance.

These traces contains metadata (span data) which can be captured by honeycomb and be shown graphically or in raw data.


#### Honeycomb open-tracing proxy

Honeycomb works with the data collected in Zipkin format. This proxy will run in your local machine and collects the zipkin formatted trace data and sends to honeycomb.
